RPM packaging files for Sublime Text

Main files are installed in /opt/sublime-text. Icons are moved to their correct
place at /usr/share/icons, and a desktop file is included in /usr/share/applications.

Unlike some other packages available online, this does not download the program
at installation time. Since Sublime Text's license does not permit redistribution,
I cannot provided pre-compiled versions. You must create them yourself.
The process is easy, fortunately.

For example, for Fedora, you need the rpmdevtools and rpm-build packages. Then,
after cd-ing to this project's folder, do:

 spectool -g sublime-text.spec
 rpmbuild --define "_sourcedir $PWD" -bb sublime-text.spec

If everything went correctly, you should see the path of the resulting RPM
printed in rpmbuild's output. e.g.:

 Wrote: /home/danielkza/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/sublime-text-3.3083-3.fc21.x86_64.rpm

Just install it and you're good to go.

If a new version has been released and I have yet not updated the spec, you
can do it yourself by simply changing the build_version variable at the top
of the file to the correct build. Then shoot me a pull request aftwerwards.
